      " Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, and is a method for data analysis that uses learning algorithms that iteratively learn from data. Deep learning is a machine learning technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans: learn by example.
